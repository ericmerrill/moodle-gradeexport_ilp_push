Things to be done:
* Different grading "schemes"
* Don't allow logged-in-as users to submit grades
* User needs ID number to grade
* Form validation with JS
* Form error handling
* Use overridable class for user-banner mapping and enrollment-course mapping
* Use the Moodle date selector
* Display that grade is changed from default (maybe with arrow pointing between them?)
* Event logging
* Check wording for default incomplete date.
* Add gradetype to course-user-revision index.
* Add support for additional certs

Things that need to be looked into:
* Default incomplete grade, and should changing that be a setting?

Possibly remove:
* saved_grade_revision?
